1. Data validation before submission of contact info on Profile screen.- done for 
email and phone values. I will keep it to that for now.
2. A bug in the app: Upon restarting the app, the Profile screen takes data 
from local storage, but that data is not stored in the individual contact info
state variables.
And upon save, the state variables' data is written in the storage. This
overwrites individual fields to empty strings for the unchanged input fields 
which are the initial values for 
the associated state variables at the time of a reload or the first use of the app.: Fixed.
