## Clock:

A react native app imitating the 'clock' screen of the Google Clock app  
alongwith its 'World clock' feature using [TimeAPI](https://www.timeapi.io/swagger/index.html).

### Changes introduced in this commit:

1. In Home Screen: The timezones passed from the Search screen are rendered on  
   this screen with their time, day, date, and city name.

### Changes in mind to be introduced in the near-future commits:

1. There should be an 'x' button to delete a timezone from this screen.
